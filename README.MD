### Analysis of Course Ratings
The average rating of courses tends to be higher for paid courses compared to free courses. Additionally, courses with higher numbers of subscribers generally have higher ratings.

# Python for Data Science: Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization

This project aims to provide a comprehensive guide on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and creating visualizations using Python. The dataset used contains details about various online courses, including features like course ratings, number of subscribers, price, and more.

**Objectives**:
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Conduct EDA to understand the data distribution and relationships.
- Visualize the data to uncover patterns and insights.
